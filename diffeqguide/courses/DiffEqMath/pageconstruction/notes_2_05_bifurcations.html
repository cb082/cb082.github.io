    <h2> Bifurcations </h2>

    <p> Some differential equations include parameters that are treated as constants when solving an ODE,
    but are worth studying at various values. A typical example of this is modeling the population of a fish species under the influence of yearly harvests by fishermen. For different amounts of harvest, we can model how a population can continue to thrive or go ultimately go extinct.</p>
