    <h2> Modeling with Differential Equations </h2>

    <p> Differential equations have a wide range of applications across the sciences, including physics, engineering, and biology. While this page is <italic> not </italic>
    meant to provide insight into all types of applications, it seeks to address the basic ideas behind developing a differential equation used to model a
    real-world situation. </p>
