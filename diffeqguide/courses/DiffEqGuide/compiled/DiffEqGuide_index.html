	Welcome to the webspace for the TLC's Differential Equations Resource Guide! This site is under heavy construction, so please be aware that the content, design, and layout will b subject to a lot of change throughout the remainder of 2025. If you have suggestions or comments, please reach out to <a href="mailto:qcoach@bucknell.edu">Cameron Bishop</a>!
</p>

<h2>How To Use This Guide </h2>

<p>
This resource guide is meant to be an evolution of the current <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9m6x0HJEJ_A239VJ9envGq2akleqC37fNR6hzFgTlc/edit?tab=t.0"> Calculus Resource Guide </a> contains short reviews of a variety of differential equations topics as well as video resources relevant to each topic. The table of contents allows you to jump right to any section for which you are seeking extra support, practice, or help.
The entire document is also searchable (working on making sure this holds up!) so you can search for specific topics in the guide. Each section is broken down into the following whenever possible.
</p>

<p> Each topics page will consist of subsections as needed: <ol> <li> Concept Summary </li> <li> Steps/Processes </li> <li> Notation </li> <li> Examples with steps</li> <li>Exercises/Practice Problems</li> <li>Videos</li></ol>
	Each section lists the major concepts you need to understand the material from that section. This list contains links that you can click to take you to the resources needed to understand that material. </p>

<h3> Videos </h3>

<p> The Videos section contains a list of videos that address the material covered in the section.  The time length of the video is included as well as the content creator. </p>

<h3> Practice Problems And Notes </h3>

The Practice Problems And Notes section contains links to Paul's Online Differential Equations Notes. There are additional practice problems with solutions and accompanying notes for most sections.  This material was created by Dr. Paul Dawkins and is freely available online. </p>

<h2> How this guide should be built</h2>

<p> The purpose of this resource guide is to provide supplemental resources for students taking differential equations courses at Bucknell University.  The resources included in this guide are not intended to replace the instruction provided by the course instructor, but rather to supplement it. 
The resources included in this guide should be high quality, free, and accessible to all students. </p>

<p> There are a few instances for which additional resources are added.  This includes certain sections where the Mathematics Department has provided WebWork Practice. </p>

<h3> This Content Should All Be Free </h3>
This guide contains videos and resources that should be freely available online.  You are not required to pay for any subscriptions or content that may be advertised in any of the videos which we have linked here. If you encounter any issues of accessibility for the linked content, please contact <a href="mailto:qcoach@bucknell.edu">Cameron Bishop</a>.

<h3> Help Us Diversify Our Content Creators </h3>
<p> Many of the videos in this document come from a small number of content creators.  Bucknell and the TLC value quality supplemental resources from a diverse group of content creators. If you would like to suggest including specific resources from specific content creators please contact <a href="mailto:qcoach@bucknell.edu">Cameron Bishop</a>.
