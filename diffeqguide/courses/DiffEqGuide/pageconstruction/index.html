	<h2> Hello! </h2>

	<p>
		Welcome to the webspace for the TLC's Differential Equations Resource Guide! This site is under heavy construction, so please be aware that the content, design, and layout will 
		be subject to a lot of change throughout the remainder of 2026. If you have suggestions or comments, please reach out to <a href="mailto:qcoach@bucknell.edu">Cameron Bishop</a>!

	<h2>How To Use This Guide </h2>

	<p>
	This resource guide is meant to be an evolution of the current <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9m6x0HJEJ_A239VJ9envGq2akleqC37fNR6hzFgTlc/edit?tab=t.0"> Calculus Resource Guide </a> contains short reviews of a variety of differential equations topics as well as video resources relevant to each topic. The table of contents allows you to jump right to any section for which you are seeking extra support, practice, or help.
	We hope to implement a search feature soon so that you can find topics more easily! Each section is broken down into the following whenever possible.
