	<h2>How To Use This Guide </h2>

	<p>
	This resource guide is meant to be an evolution of the current <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9m6x0HJEJ_A239VJ9envGq2akleqC37fNR6hzFgTlc/edit?tab=t.0"> Calculus Resource Guide </a> contains short reviews of a variety of differential equations topics as well as video resources relevant to each topic. The table of contents allows you to jump right to any section for which you are seeking extra support, practice, or help.
	We hope to implement a search feature soon so that you can find topics more easily! Each section is broken down into the following whenever possible.
