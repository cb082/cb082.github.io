<h2>How To Use This Guide </h2>

<p>
This resource guide is meant to be an evolution of the current <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9m6x0HJEJ_A239VJ9envGq2akleqC37fNR6hzFgTlc/edit?tab=t.0"> Calculus Resource Guide </a> contains short reviews of a variety of differential equations topics as well as video resources relevant to each topic. The table of contents allows you to jump right to any section for which you are seeking extra support, practice, or help.
The entire document is also searchable (working on making sure this holds up!) so you can search for specific topics in the guide. Each section is broken down into the following whenever possible.
