<h1>Introduction to Differential Equations</h1>

<p> This page is meant to address the question of "What is a differential equation?" and provide some basic terminology. </p>

<div class="definition">
An <bold>ordinary differential equation</bold> (<bold>ODE</bold>) is an equation consisting of an independent variable, say \(x\),
a dependent variable, say \(y\), and derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable. Very formally it
can be written to look like \[f(x, y, y', \dots, y^{(n)}) = 0\] for some positive integer \(n\).
