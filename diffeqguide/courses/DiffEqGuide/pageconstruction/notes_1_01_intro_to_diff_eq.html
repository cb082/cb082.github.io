    <h1>Introduction to Differential Equations</h1>

    <p> This page is meant to address the question of "What is a differential equation?" and provide some basic terminology. </p>

    <div class="definition">
    An <bold>ordinary differential equation</bold> (<bold>ODE</bold>) is an equation consisting of an independent variable, say \(x\),
    a dependent variable, say \(y\), and derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable. Very formally it
    can be written to look like \[f(x, y, y', \dots, y^{(n)}) = 0\] for some positive integer \(n\).
    </div>

    <div class = "examples"> The following are examples of ODEs:
        <ul> <li> \(y' = y\) </li> <li> \(x^2y'' - xy' + y = \cos(x)\) </li> </ul>

    </div>

    <div class = "definition"> An <bold> autonomous </bold> ODE is an ODE that has no explicit dependence on the dependent variable.
