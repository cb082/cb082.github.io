	<h3> Practice Problems And Notes </h3>

	<p> The Practice Problems And Notes section contains links to Paul's Online Differential Equations Notes. There are additional practice problems with solutions and accompanying notes for most sections.  This material was created by Dr. Paul Dawkins and is freely available online. </p>

	<h2> How this guide should be built</h2>

	<p> The purpose of this resource guide is to provide supplemental resources for students taking differential equations courses at Bucknell University.  The resources included in this guide are not intended to replace the instruction provided by the course instructor, but rather to supplement it. 
	The resources included in this guide should be high quality, free, and accessible to all students. </p>

	<p> There are a few instances for which additional resources are added.  This includes certain sections where the Mathematics Department has provided WebWork Practice. </p>

	<h3> This Content Should All Be Free </h3>
	<p> This guide contains videos and resources that should be freely available online.  You are not required to pay for any subscriptions or content that may be advertised in any of the videos which we have linked here. If you encounter any issues of accessibility for the linked content, please contact <a href="mailto:qcoach@bucknell.edu">Cameron Bishop</a>. </p>

	<h3> Help Us Diversify Our Content Creators </h3>
	<p> Many of the videos in this document come from a small number of content creators.  Bucknell and the TLC value quality supplemental resources from a diverse group of content creators.
