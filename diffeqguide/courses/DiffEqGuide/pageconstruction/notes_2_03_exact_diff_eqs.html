    <h1> Exact Differential Equations </h1>

    <div class=definition> We say that a first-order differential equation of the form \[P(x,y) + Q(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad P(x,y)dx + Q(x,y)dy = 0\]
    is <bold> exact </bold> if \[\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}.\] If this is the case, then there is a function \(\Phi(x,y)\) so that
    \[\dfrac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} = P(x, y) \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad \dfrac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y} = Q(x,y).\]
