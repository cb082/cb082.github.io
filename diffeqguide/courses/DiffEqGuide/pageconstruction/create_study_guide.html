<h2> Guidelines For Creating A Study Guide </h2>

<p> <strong> Step 1:</strong> First make a list of topics or sections that the assessment will cover. This can start
with the big ideas and then you can fill in the finer details. The goal here is to create an
outline of the types of questions that can be asked. It should be exhaustive and
comprehensive. Many times your textbook will have a summary at the end of each
section which has important information about the topics covered in that section. You
can use these summaries to create the outline. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 2:</strong> Make a list of formulas that will be needed for the exam. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 3:</strong> For any topic that requires a formula, write down that formula or the name of
that formula next to the topic. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 4:</strong> Make a list of terminology that must be known for the exam. Write out in words
what each term means. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 5:</strong> For any topic which has an algorithmic solution write down the step by step
algorithm. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 6:</strong> For each topic, make a list of problems that can be used as practice. These might
be examples done in class, homework problems, or problems not assigned from the
textbook for which you have the solutions or answers. </p>

<p> <strong> Chunking </strong>
Once your study guide is made, do not try to study everything in one sitting. Instead go
through your study guide and schedule times to practice each topic. The most eﬃcient
way to do this is to spend more time on things that are your biggest needs. This assumes
that these topics will have a significant presence on your assessment. Sometimes there
are minor topics which would require a large amount of time to master, but won't make
up a large enough portion of the assessment. In these cases, you would want to focus on
these topics last and only if time permits. </p>

<p> <strong>Practice </strong>
If you are solving problems with your book open or your notes open, you are not really
practicing yet. You want to build up to being able to answer questions without
referencing any outside materials. Simply reading solutions to problems is not going to
have a high transfer rate. </p>
