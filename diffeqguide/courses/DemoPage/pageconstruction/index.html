    <h2> Welcome! </h2>

    <p> Welcome to the DemoPage! This is meant as a companion to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTf_4UyEV3DMcxznP7i-0Ko5TlkKkJnVpRJz-Mycfh8/edit?tab=t.0"> How-To Guide</a>.
        Here we can explore what we may look to include in the Differential Equations Guide. It also serves as a template for parallel course guides that we can link to and from the Diffential Equations Guide.
        For the actual guide, see <a href ="../../DiffEqMath/compiled/DiffEqMath_index.html"> DiffEq Guide</a>.
